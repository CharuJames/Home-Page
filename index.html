            <p>My name is Charu Karakkaparambil James, and I am deeply passionate about using artificial intelligence to address complex and impactful challenges. My work primarily revolves around Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I specialize in exploring innovative techniques and methodologies to advance the field.</p>
            <p>My research interests include Dynamic Topic Modeling, which seeks to understand and model how topics evolve over time, and Continual Learning, a paradigm that enables AI systems to learn and adapt continuously without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Additionally, I focus on cross-lingual knowledge distillation, a cutting-edge approach to transferring knowledge between languages and enhancing the performance and generalization of AI models across diverse linguistic contexts.</p>
            <p>Through my work, I strive to push the boundaries of AI to develop solutions that solve complex problems and bridge linguistic and cultural gaps, ultimately contributing to a more interconnected and informed world.</p>
